A positive integer matrix is a matrix whose elements are all positive integers.
Some positive integer matrices can be expressed as a square of a positive integer matrix in two different ways. Here is an example:

[ 40 12 ] = [2  3]^2 = [6 1]^2
[ 48 40 ]   [12 2]     [4 6]


We define F(N) as the number of the 2x2 positive integer matrices which have a trace less than N and which can be expressed as a square of a positive integer matrix in two different ways.
We can verify that F(50) = 7 and F(1000) = 1019.

Find F(107).
